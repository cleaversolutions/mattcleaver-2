subtitle: Cars are a guilty pleasure of mine.

My love of cars started in 1994 when I was 11 years old. My dad brought home a Corvette, along with a brochure from the dealer, and I read it cover to cover. I then started subscribing to *Road and Track* and *Car and Driver*. 

In 1995 I attended my first sports car race, an IMSA race at Texas World Speedway during the World Sports Car era. I was hooked.

The interesting cars I have owned over the years include:

- 1990 Mustang LX 5.0
- 1999 Pontiac Firehawk
- 1994 Mazda Miata
- 2013 Volkswagen GTI

I have raced:

- Gold Racing Kart, Yamaha KT100 engine
- 1986 BMW 325e
- Mazda Miata
- Kia Sephia
- Porsche 944 with a 5.3L Cheverolet V-8
- 2nd Generation Mazda RX-7 with a Ford 5.0 V-8
