<p>After deciding we were going to enter our own team in next year's 24 Hours of Lemons, we expected to have another 12 months to get a team and car together before the rolling circus returned to Houston.</p>
<p>But on November 15, 2008 the 2009 schedule was announced, and the first race of the season was February 28 in Houston, a mere 15 weeks away. We didn't have a car or a team. We'd never built a racecar from scratch. We'd never managed an endurance race team. We barely had room in the garage to work on a car. Could we do this?</p>
<p>Probably not, but we took the plunge and registered for the race anyways. Instantly our search was on for a car. At the time, Drew was going to school in Arkansas, Matt lived in the Dallas Area, and Price was in Houston. We were on Craigslist constantly for about a week looking for the perfect car anywhere in Texas, Oklahoma, or Arkansas. We aren't too mechanically inclined, but we are super competitive, so we were looking for a car that could compete for an overall win that we could get put together over Christmas break.</p>
<p>We decided we really wanted an e30 BMW for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are a popular racing car, so there are plenty of safety parts available for them. Roll cages and brake parts were easy to find. Although racing a 1968 Lancia might have won us the Index of Effluency, we had no idea how to make a roll cage from scratch or if we would have the know-how to fix it up.</li>
<li>They are a popular racing car, so there is plenty of free information floating around the internet about how to prep and fix them.</li>
<li>They are old enough to be easy to work on, but they're still a BMW and have racing in their blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Matt found what looked to be the perfect car on Craigslist in the Dallas area. It was a 1986 BMW 325e for sale for $750 "or best offer." According to the ad the car ran and had a manual transmission that was broken. Perfect!</p>
<p>The "e" model is much less desirable than the "i" model because it had a much more economical engine. Compare:</p>
<ul>
<li>325e: 121 hp and 172 lb·ft. Redline: 4,800 RPM.</li>
<li>325i: 168 hp and 164 lb·ft. Redline: 6,500 RPM.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the 325e motors were known for their low-end torque, fuel milage, and reliability. Could this be the perfect Lemons car? Only one way to find out.</p>
