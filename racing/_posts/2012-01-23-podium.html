<p>We're entering our fourth season of racing our $500 BMW, and after having many great races that ended in tears, we have finally finished on the podium. After we finished sixth in our very first race (during which we had a significant setback) we thought a podium would be soon-to-come. Boy, we we wrong.</p>
<p>This weekend we headed towards New Orleans to take part in the first race ever held at the brand-new New Orleans Motorsports Park. There was still a lot of construction to be finished, but it was obvious from the progress that this was going to be a world-class facility. No offense to the other tracks that have been built recently in Texas, but this track and its facilities beats them all. The racing surface is smooth, curbs appear up to FIA spec, and the garages and other buildings look upscale.</p>
<p>We ran the 1.8 mile configuration, which features a high speed section of esses on the back side of the track that our car exits right at 100 mph. It's a really fun section of track.</p>
<p>There was no practice, so when the green flag dropped on Saturday for a 9AM-9PM 12-hour race, everyone was seeing the track for the first time. Our car is very forgiving and easy to drive quickly, so we were able to find the limits very quickly. For the first few hours, we held the fastest lap of the race.</p>
<p>Early in the first stint, Drew felt some weirdness in the front end and thought we had a wheel bearing going bed. He pulled in and we looked at it, lost some laps, and said it looked safe-ish. A post-race inspection back at home in the garage revealed that the bearing was indeed failing. Thankfully it held on long enough to last the rest of the race.</p>
<p>Once that issues was behind us, we just turned in quick laps all day long and headed into the night. I was in the car as night was falling, and the darker it got, the more it became apparent that our headlights weren't aimed very well. I made it work, and turned the car over to the other drivers for the last two stints. Drew got into the car for the final stint, and on his out lap realized that his shoulder harness had popped out. He pitted for us to fix that, losing a few more laps in the process.</p>
<p>As he was starting to get comfortable with our crappy headlights in the night, a Ford Escort wagon must have dropped 5 gallons of oil on the track, because we were under caution for an hour while that was being cleaned up. The leader was experiencing problems with their differential, and that yellow flag really saved them from having to push it.</p>
<p>Once the track went green with about 20 minutes to go we had a big gap back to fourth place, so Drew took it easy and brought the car home to our first podium finish, third place.</p>
