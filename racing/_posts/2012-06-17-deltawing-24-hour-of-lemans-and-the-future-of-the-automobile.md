When we say we are Racing Geeks, we aren't kidding. Engineering marvels are one of the things that keeps drawing me back to motorsports. Unfortunately, the rules in most series are so specific that there is no room for innovation. What if an engineer was allowed to design a car from a clean sheet of paper, with no rules constraints? You might get the DeltaWing, racing this weekend at the 24 Hours of LeMans.

This car is immensely important, for a few reasons that Geeks like us appreciate:

- **Simplicity wins**. Hydrogen fuel cells, electric vehicles, and hybrids are touted as the future of the automobile because of their fuel efficiency. But the DeltaWing went a different direction. Instead of inventing a new fuel-efficient technology, they are using existing technology to achieve superior performance and fuel economy. This car turns LMP2 lap times with a conventional 300hp four cylinder. But it is lighter, smaller, and has a tiny aerodynamic footprint. Congress, the EPA, and CAFE should take notice.
- **It is the beta version**. This car takes a whole different approach to the physics of racing. Most of the weight of the car is carried by the rear axle, allowing the front axle to be very narrow, running four inch tires, and still able to turn. All of the cars sharing the track this weekend are a model that has been refined for the last 100 years or so. Give engineers all over the world a few years to tweak and perfect this new model, and who knows what will happen. As it sits today, in its beta state, it is turning comparable lap times to an LMP2 car.
- **Lightness=less consumables**. Lightness doesn't only mean better fuel efficiency, it means less of everything. The car is going stint after stint on the same set of tires, even though the fronts are only 4 inches wide! An LMP1 tire is 14 inches wide and they don't last as long.
- **Hybrids are dangerous**. There was a wreck at LeMans by one of the hybrid Toyotas and it took the safety crew over three minutes to reach the driver. The reason? Safety workers had to be sure the electric charge in the car was discharged or secure before approaching the vehicle. To move a vehicle weighing thousands of pounds at driving speed for any distance requires a massive amount of energy. Right now, we are still figuring out how to store and recover kinetic energy through electricity or flywheels. If the DeltaWing is in a crash, safety workers can approach the car immediately without having to worry about being electrocuted when assisting the driver.
