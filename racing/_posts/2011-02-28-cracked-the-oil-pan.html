<p>After running a full day Saturday at MSR Houston and being in the top 5, our drivers had been complaining that the car was acting odd in the rear end, so we took a look at it. And... we had broken our left rear spring. It was in three pieces. <em>Hmmm, that's odd,</em> we thought. The car had some cheap (because, ummm, it broke) lowering springs on it when we bought it and we didn't have any spares.</p>
<p>So we started walking around the pits looking for a set of rear springs. Usually we were met with the response of, "You broke a spring? I've never heard of that before."</p>
<p>Then we found an e30 with a set of stock rear spring we could use. We put them on, stepped back, and the rear end of the car had to be jacked up at least two inches. But no one else had rear springs that fit, so we decided to go with it. We were arguing all night about how the increased rake would affect the handling of the car.</p>
<p>Sunday it turned out that the car handled just fine. It looked funny, but at least we had four springs instead of three. We were running in 2nd/3rd/4th place coming into our last pit stop and driver change. About when we were pitting, the leader pulled off the track with a blown engine.</p>
<p>During the pit stop, we looked under the car... and there was a puddle of oil. The increased rake of the car had altered the weight distribution and geometry enough to lower the front end a bit, and we cracked our oil pan.</p>
<p>We didn't have a spare oil pan, so we JB welded and duct taped it. It worked good enough to let us limp around to finish 12th, 31 laps down.</p>
<p>All because of a broken spring.</p>
