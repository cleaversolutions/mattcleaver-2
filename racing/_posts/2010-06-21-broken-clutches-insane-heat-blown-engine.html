<p>This weekend sucked. We were at Eagle's Canyon Raceway in Decatur, TX.</p>
<p>It all started Friday during practice when, again, the clutch started slipping. After replacing the rear main seal on the engine, we thought we had our clutch problems figured out. So, we took the darn thing apart again and realized that the transmission seal was bad and was leaking oil from the other direction.</p>
<p>So, we made some phone calls to local auto parts stores and found the seal we needed and a clutch. The problem was, it was in two different stores. So, a couple of people drove towards Dallas to pick up the seal and I drove towards Fort Worth to pick up the clutch. The guys driving towards Dallas got a ticket to top it all off.</p>
<p>Saturday morning we got everything put back together. Once we hit the track, the car was running good, but soon it started getting <em>hot</em>. Like, over 100 degrees. We decided we were going to limit things in order to stay safe and only drive stints for 1 hour. Usually we go closer to 2 hours.</p>
<p>I was up spotting a little after noon and realized that our car hadn't come around the track for about four minutes. I couldn't get any response from the radio. So, I walked back to our pit spot and found our driver in the trailer with the air conditioning on and an ice-cold towel on his head. He was suffering from heat exhaustion. He only lasted about 45 minutes before he started feeling delirious and couldn't even talk on the radio, so he came into the pits.</p>
<p>After that, we limited stints to 3o minutes. That seemed to help, but for the first time in our racing lives, our drivers actually <em>didn't want to get in the car to drive</em>. It was that hot. But we finished the day without anymore heat exhaustion and the car ran well.</p>
<p>Sunday we were just trying to keep things fun and safe. Everything was going fine until about an hour to go on Sunday when I saw a huge puff of white smoke coming out of our tailpipe. I radioed to our driver that it looked like the motor was finished. The car stopped on the back side of the track and had to be towed in.</p>
<p>We opened the hood and realized that the lower coolant hose had gotten pushed up into the engine block and melted a hole in it. We were running without any water and the head gasket behaved accordingly. Ugh.</p>
<p>When it was all said and done, we finished 42nd out of 75, 101 laps behind. But we were tired, sunburned, and had some major repair work ahead of us.</p>
