<p>If you've been watching the coverage of NASCAR's Daytona Speedweeks &amp; Daytona 500, you've probably noticed that besides Danica Patrick the hot topic of conversation has been the new-fangled electronic fuel injection (EFI) systems used on the cars.</p>
<p>One commentator said,</p>
<blockquote><p>We're just not going to know how these new systems behave when a car stalls on pit road or runs out of gas.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's a bit interesting how they speak of this technology as something so new and unknown, seeing as our $500 racecar from 1986 is equipped with said technology, which has been in development since the 1950s. I'm pretty sure the engineers will have this figured out just fine.</p>
<p>With every year, NASCAR is inching ever closer to embracing the technology of our $500 racecar. Of course, we still have an independent rear suspension.</p>
