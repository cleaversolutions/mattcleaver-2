<p>So, if you know anything about our team, you know that I (Matt) don't usually do the driving. I leave that to people who have actually been on a racetrack before. I tend to focus on the truly geeky thing about our race team: leading and managing the team, crafting a strategy, calculating fuel mileage, calling pit stops, calming drivers and spotting on the radio. I'm the geek-glue that holds things together.</p>
<p>But this weekend we had trouble getting our team together and were short a driver, so I figured, hey, why not. I borrowed a bunch of gear and we got out to the track early Friday morning so I would have plenty of time to get comfortable before race day Saturday.</p>
<p>I got suited up, strapped in, and made my way out on the track around 10:00AM. I took an easy out lap just to make sure I remembered the direction of the corners. My second lap, I stood on the gas and, "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA".</p>
<p>The clutch was slipping. Bad.</p>
<p>Bad, but not surprising. We had no idea how many miles were on that clutch when we bought it, so it is actually a surprise that we made it two races without it giving up.</p>
<p>We took it apart and realized the rear main seal was leaking and dumping oil on the clutch. A few calls to local auto parts stores and we found our parts. After picking up the parts we came back to the track, opened up the box, and...</p>
<p>The clutch didn't fit. The spline wasn't right. We checked the part number on the box and it was the right number, but the wrong part. By now it was getting late. No stores had what we needed in stock, but they could have them at 7:00AM in the morning. The race started at 10:00. Arg.</p>
<p>So, we went back to the hotel, went to bed, and got up early to go parts hunting again. This time we got the right part.</p>
<p>By the time everything was buttoned up, it was a little bit before noon. Needless to say, our goals for this race were just to have fun. So, we did. We took things easy, didn't stress out, and just had a fun weekend once we got the car put back together.</p>

It was a bit intimidating to go out onto the racetrack for the first time under race conditions without any laps in the car, but at least it wasn't raining... until a few laps later. Most of my stint was plagued by rain or a damp track. It was fun sliding around out there, but I didn't get a chance to really know how well I was driving because I couldn't compare lap times with my co-drivers.</p>
<p>When it was all said and done on Sunday, we finished 64th out of 122 cars, 105 laps down from the leaders. Oh well, at least we have a new clutch that should last us a while.</p>
