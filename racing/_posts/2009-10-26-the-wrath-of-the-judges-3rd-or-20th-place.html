<p>Going through the BS line at a Lemons race is always an interesting event. We brought our car out for its second race, the only modifications since the last race being some fresh oil. Since we got zero penalty laps at the last race, we were pretty confident we'd be sitting pretty again.</p>
<p>We were wrong.</p>
<p>The judges decided they were going to test cars for limited slip differentials and look for cheaters. We told them we were pretty sure our car had an LSD, but they wanted to see for themselves. We jacked the rear end in the air, spun a tire, watched the other one turn the opposite direction.</p>
<p>We thought, "Sweet." The judges thought "Cheaters."</p>
<p>They were convinced that there wasn't a BMW 325e equipped with an LSD from the factory. We pleaded with them that there was a limited run of 325es (which had the differential), and that, regardless, that was how we bought our hooptie. They didn't buy it, and gave us a 30 lap penalty.</p>
<p>Needless to say, our dreams of finishing up front were dashed with that decree from the high court.</p>
<p>The race was quite uneventful. We had one penalty early in the race that cost us three laps, but after that it was smooth sailing.</p>
<p>We completed 305 laps, which would have put us in 3rd place, 5 laps behind the race winner. Alas, after our 30 lap penalty, we officially finished in 20th place. What could have been.</p>
<p>Stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Race: Yee Haw It's Lemons Texas 2009</li>
<li>Track: MSR Houston</li>
<li>Result: 20th out of 122, including our 30 lap penalty</li>
</ul>
