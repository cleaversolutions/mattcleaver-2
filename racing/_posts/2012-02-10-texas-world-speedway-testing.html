Professional race teams do "testing," crapcan racers typically just show up, hope their car runs, and start the race.</p>
<p>But, we're planning to do our first 24 hour ChumpCar race this May at <a title="Texas World Speedway" href="http://www.texasworldspeedway.com/" target="_blank">Texas World Speedway</a>, and we got an email about an affordable open track day on February 10th, so we jumped at the opportunity to get our car on TWS for the first time. And, since TWS is only about an hour away from our team's home base, it made it a great opportunity. Almost all of our team has experience at this track, but the BMW has never been here, so we wanted to see how our car behaved.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it rained like crazy the day before and morning of the track day, so we didn't really start pushing the car until 1:00 PM or so. We were using leftover tires from the NOLA race, and the tread wasn't very conducive to running on a wet track.</p>
<p>Once the track dried out, we were about to push the car and turned some pretty competitive laps. Unfortunately, for one thing or another, we had lots of red flags that really cut down on our green flag laps. We think our car will be fairly strong for running up front in the 24 hour race, but we're at a pretty big disadvantage on the big front straightaway. On the rest of the track, our car is really quick. That is assuming that we run the counter-clockwise configuration.</p>

<p>We also spent the last hour of the track day changing tires and wheels and putting on a brand new set to heat cycle them for the May race. We've never heat cycled a tire before, so we'll see if we can tell a difference in the durability of the tires over the course of the 24 hours race.</p>
<p>We're looking forward to our next race at Texas World Speedway in May.</p>
